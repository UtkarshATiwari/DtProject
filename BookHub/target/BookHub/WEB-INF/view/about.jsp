	 		<h1>Laptop Perform Multiple Task with Ease</h1>
	 		Want to surf internet or play games online? Want to stream  videos, create power point presentation or edit a document? A laptop will let you perform 
	 		all these task with ease. Although desktop computers also help you with this, they are bulky and you can not carry them from one place to another place.
	 		That's why most people prefer buying laptops. Theyb bare sleek, compact, powerful and can be easly carried with you anywhere you want, so you dont even have to worry 
	 		about missing out on all the updates when you are not at work.
